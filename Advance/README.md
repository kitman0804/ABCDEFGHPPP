## Advance Challenges 
PCs in this age have very powerful computation power. Thus, Base 10 `AB - CD = EF, EF - GH = PPP` is too easy to compute the result. That's why someone even said that brute-force is also be accepted. 

Let's try more complicated scenario, all alphabats repersent a single value (in base) & distinct. It will be easier to see the significant performance difference of each approach.

#### Advance 
Base 16 `AB - CD = EF, EF - GH = PPP` (Width = 2)

Base 22 `AB - CD = EF, EF - GH = PPP` (Width = 2)

Base 28 `AB - CD = EF, EF - GH = PPP` (Width = 2)

Base 34 `AB - CD = EF, EF - GH = PPP` (Width = 2)

Base 17 `ABCD - EFGH = IJKL, IJKL + MNOP = QQQQQ` (Width = 4)

Base 21 `ABCD - EFGH = IJKL, IJKL + MNOP = QQQQQ` (Width = 4)

Base 25 `ABCD - EFGH = IJKL, IJKL + MNOP = QQQQQ` (Width = 4)

Base 29 `ABCD - EFGH = IJKL, IJKL + MNOP = QQQQQ` (Width = 4)

...

** You must solve at least 2 of them **
